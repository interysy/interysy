<samp align = "center" > My name is Michal and I am currently a student at the University Of Glasgow, looking to get a degree in Electronic and Software Engineering. Although at this moment in time this profile hasn't got too much code, but I am hoping to change that in the future! I have recently finished working on <a href = "https://github.com/interysy/University-Of-Glasgow-Grade-Calculator-Web-App">this</a>, if you would be willing to check it out ! </samp>
